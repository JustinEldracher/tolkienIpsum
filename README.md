# tolkienIpsum
A Tolkien-themed lipsum generator built with Django

Teaching myself Django with this. Maybe it's overkill for this project, but you have to start somewhere!

If you want to try it out just make sure you have `python3` installed and do

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/flyingfisch/tolkienIpsum/
$ cd tolkienIpsum
$ ./manage.py runserver
~~~

Then go to `http://localhost:8000/generator/10/5/15' in a browser and check it out!
